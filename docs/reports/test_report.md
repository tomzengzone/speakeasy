## 2026-05-26 - PB-P0-BE-001A Backend/DB Foundation Test Report

Test scope:
- Spring Boot backend skeleton and dependency wiring.
- Flyway baseline migration for Product Base and P0 commercial foundation tables.
- Real PostgreSQL 15 migration execution through Testcontainers.
- Minimal P0 commercial API surface already present in `docs/architecture/openapi/speakeasy-api.yaml`: `/subscription/plans`, `/entitlements`, `/usage/summary`, `/user/me`, `/admin/release-health`.
- OpenAPI contract and Dart client pre-generation drift gate.

Commands run:
- `docker version` - passed after Docker Desktop was started; server version 29.0.1.
- `mvn test -Dtest=PostgresFoundationMigrationTest` from `backend/` - first failed with Testcontainers 1.19.8 / Docker Engine 29 compatibility; passed after pinning Testcontainers 2.0.5.
- `mvn test` from `backend/` - passed after dependency download approval, one test cleanup fix, one DTO contract assertion fix, and PostgreSQL Testcontainers addition.
- `npm.cmd run check:api-contract` from repository root - passed.

Passing tests:
- `com.speakeasy.FoundationMigrationTest.pbP0FoundationTablesExist` verifies the migration creates `user_accounts`, `auth_identities`, `user_profiles`, `onboarding_assessments`, `learning_routes`, `scenarios`, `scenario_versions`, `scenario_levels`, `target_expressions`, `subscription_plans`, `purchases`, `subscriptions`, `entitlement_snapshots`, `usage_ledgers`, `usage_reservations`, `payment_provider_events`, `account_deletion_jobs`, and `audit_logs`.
- `com.speakeasy.PostgresFoundationMigrationTest.pbP0FoundationMigrationAppliesOnPostgres` verifies the Flyway baseline applies successfully to PostgreSQL 15.17 and creates the required foundation tables.
- `com.speakeasy.CommercialFoundationControllerTest.listSubscriptionPlansReturnsOpenApiShapedResponse` covers FR-COM-001 and FR-COM-009 response shape for `/subscription/plans`.
- `com.speakeasy.CommercialFoundationControllerTest.getEntitlementsReturnsLatestSnapshot` covers FR-COM-001, FR-COM-006, and FR-COM-007 foundation response shape for `/entitlements`, including explicit `features` and `generated_at` DTO fields.
- `com.speakeasy.CommercialFoundationControllerTest.getUsageSummaryReturnsLedger` covers FR-COM-010 / AC-COM-012 foundation response shape for `/usage/summary`.
- `com.speakeasy.CommercialFoundationControllerTest.requestAccountDeletionCreatesJob` covers FR-COM-008 / AC-COM-010 foundation behavior for `DELETE /user/me`, including the OpenAPI top-level `deletion_job_id`, `status`, and `requested_at` fields.
- `com.speakeasy.CommercialFoundationControllerTest.releaseHealthRemainsWarningUntilProviderAndReleaseGatesExist` covers FR-COM-011 and FR-COM-012 release-health warning behavior for unfinished provider/release gates.
- `npm.cmd run check:api-contract` passed Redocly lint, OpenAPI contract examples, and Dart client pre-generation drift gate.

Failing tests:
- None remaining.
- During implementation, the first real `mvn test` run failed because `CommercialFoundationControllerTest` deleted `user_accounts` before `account_deletion_jobs`. The test setup now deletes deletion jobs first.
- During DTO contract hardening, one test still asserted the old nested `deletion_job.status` shape. The test now asserts the OpenAPI top-level account deletion response shape.
- During PostgreSQL validation, the first Testcontainers run failed because Spring Boot dependency management selected Testcontainers 1.19.8, which did not connect cleanly to Docker Engine 29. The backend now pins Testcontainers 2.0.5 modules.

Skipped or unavailable tests:
- Provider verification tests for Apple/Google purchase validation, restore, webhooks, refund/expiry, and production secrets are not part of PB-P0-BE-001A.
- Flutter/generated Dart client integration tests are not part of PB-P0-BE-001A.

Acceptance criteria coverage:
- Product Base FR-001, FR-002, FR-003, FR-005, FR-006, FR-008, FR-010 are covered at foundation persistence level through migration table assertions; user-facing Product Base flows remain covered by existing Flutter evidence in Product Base traceability.
- FR-COM-001 / AC-COM-001, AC-COM-005, AC-COM-006 are partially covered by subscription/entitlement persistence and read endpoints; real purchase verification and refresh remain follow-up.
- FR-COM-006 / AC-COM-006 and FR-COM-007 / AC-COM-007 are covered only as entitlement snapshot/read foundation, not full gating enforcement.
- FR-COM-008 / AC-COM-010 is covered by deletion job creation foundation, not full cloud data deletion/anonymization execution.
- FR-COM-010 / AC-COM-012 is covered by usage ledger read foundation, not reserve/commit/release enforcement.
- FR-COM-011 / AC-COM-013 and FR-COM-012 / AC-COM-014 are covered by release-health warning behavior, not final release checklist approval.

Residual risk:
- This is a backend/database foundation slice. It is suitable as the next dependency layer, but not sufficient for production commercial launch.
- Auth, authorization, provider secrets, payment provider calls, webhook signature verification, generated Dart client wiring, and Flutter membership/entitlement UI integration remain downstream work.

## 2026-05-27 - PB-P0-BE-001B Auth/Security + User Identity Boundary Test Report

Test scope:
- Spring Security stateless bearer-token baseline.
- Opaque access/refresh session persistence through `auth_sessions`.
- Minimal `/auth/login/phone`, `/auth/login/apple`, `/auth/login/wechat`, `/auth/refresh`, and `/auth/logout` behavior.
- `GET/PATCH/DELETE /user/me` current-user binding.
- `/entitlements` and `/usage/summary` authenticated-user binding and removal of production `X-User-Id` reliance.
- H2 and PostgreSQL migration validation for the new auth session table.
- OpenAPI contract and Dart client pre-generation drift gate.

Commands run:
- `mvn.cmd -q "-Dtest=AuthServiceTest,AuthControllerTest,CommercialFoundationControllerTest,FoundationMigrationTest" test` from `backend/` - first failed because one seeded test token used a fixed 2026-05-26 timestamp and was expired on 2026-05-27; passed after the fixture used current time.
- `mvn.cmd test` from `backend/` - passed after QA gap fixes, 19 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors.
- `npm.cmd run check:api-contract` from repository root - passed.

Passing tests:
- `com.speakeasy.AuthControllerTest.getMeRequiresBearerToken` verifies protected current-user API returns `UNAUTHENTICATED` without bearer auth.
- `com.speakeasy.AuthControllerTest.patchAndDeleteMeRequireBearerToken` verifies `PATCH /user/me` and `DELETE /user/me` reject unauthenticated requests with shared error schema.
- `com.speakeasy.AuthControllerTest.loginAndGetMeBindToCurrentUser` verifies phone login issues tokens and `GET /user/me` uses the token user while ignoring `X-User-Id`.
- `com.speakeasy.AuthControllerTest.patchMeUpdatesAuthenticatedUserProfile` verifies authenticated `PATCH /user/me` updates display name, level, daily minutes, and reminder fields.
- `com.speakeasy.AuthControllerTest.refreshRotatesTokenAndLogoutRevokesSession` verifies refresh rotation invalidates the previous access token, the new token works, logout returns 204, and the logged-out token is rejected.
- `com.speakeasy.AuthControllerTest.refreshRejectsInvalidToken` verifies invalid refresh tokens return `UNAUTHENTICATED`.
- `com.speakeasy.AuthControllerTest.loginRejectsUnsupportedSchemaVersion` verifies runtime request validation rejects unsupported `schema_version` values.
- `com.speakeasy.AuthServiceTest.loginCreatesRefreshableSessionBoundToUser` verifies service-level login, token authentication, refresh rotation, and old access token invalidation.
- `com.speakeasy.AuthServiceTest.logoutRevokesCurrentSession` verifies service-level logout revokes access.
- `com.speakeasy.AuthServiceTest.loginRejectsMissingTerms` verifies terms gating in the login substitute.
- `com.speakeasy.CommercialFoundationControllerTest.getEntitlementsReturnsLatestSnapshot` verifies entitlement lookup uses authenticated user identity and ignores `X-User-Id`.
- `com.speakeasy.CommercialFoundationControllerTest.getUsageSummaryReturnsLedger` verifies usage summary lookup uses authenticated user identity.
- `com.speakeasy.CommercialFoundationControllerTest.requestAccountDeletionCreatesJob` verifies authenticated account deletion creates a job.
- `com.speakeasy.CommercialFoundationControllerTest.entitlementSummaryRequiresAuthentication` verifies unauthenticated entitlement access is rejected.
- `com.speakeasy.CommercialFoundationControllerTest.usageSummaryRequiresAuthentication` verifies unauthenticated usage summary access is rejected.
- `com.speakeasy.FoundationMigrationTest.pbP0FoundationTablesExist` verifies H2 migration includes `auth_sessions`.
- `com.speakeasy.PostgresFoundationMigrationTest.pbP0FoundationMigrationAppliesOnPostgres` verifies Flyway migrations, including `auth_sessions`, apply to PostgreSQL 15.17 through Testcontainers.

Failing tests:
- None remaining.

Skipped or unavailable tests:
- Real Apple/WeChat login provider verification is not implemented in this slice.
- Apple/Google subscription verify/restore, webhooks, refund/expiry downgrade, usage reserve/commit/release, generated Dart client, and Flutter integration are outside PB-P0-BE-001B.

Acceptance criteria coverage:
- Product Base FR-001 / Flow-002 is covered for server-side login/session/logout baseline, not real social-provider verification.
- Product Base FR-010 / AC-011 is covered for authenticated current-user profile read/update and account deletion job creation/session revocation.
- P0 FR-COM-004 / AC-COM-008 is covered for removing production `X-User-Id` identity substitution from protected backend paths.
- P0 FR-COM-001, FR-COM-006, FR-COM-007 are covered for authenticated entitlement read foundation, not full entitlement refresh/gating.
- P0 FR-COM-010 / AC-COM-012 is covered for authenticated usage summary read foundation, not reserve/commit/release.

Residual risk:
- This slice is an auth/security boundary baseline, not production social login or payment verification.
- Full account deletion processing and commercial release health gates remain downstream.
